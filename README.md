This is an effort to improve the datasets used for training deep learning models for observational seismology.

We documented a series of erros or faulty labels in a number of machine learning datasets, focused on local earthquake recordings

There is a csv file for every dataset analyzed that contains the names and reeerence to the exmaples in the datasets per their Seisbench metadata. This is with the goal of avoiding them when training and testing.
